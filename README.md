# Tabs (need better name)

A browser extension (currently Firefox-only). Open current tab as a localhost (with same path / queries, etc)

ðŸ‘† Gif explains better than my bad words

## How it works

This is not a *published* extension, but there is a signed/packaged release available at [https://github.com/miclgael/tabs/releases/](https://github.com/miclgael/tabs/releases/)

Supports Firefox + Firefox For Android v57+

**If you're developing..**

You can load the extension in debug mode. Navigate to [about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox](about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox). From there you can load it as a temporary add-on by opening the manifest file.

## Using the add-on

Once installed, you can right-click any open tab to find a new "Tabs" menu, somewhere at the bottom of the list.

You should go to the Options page, and set up your development URLs.

There is no checking or conversion of these strings, so make sure *DO* include a protocol, but *DON'T* include a trailing `/` on your URLs.

âœ… Good: `http://localhost:8888` <br>
ðŸš« Bad: `localhost:8888/`
